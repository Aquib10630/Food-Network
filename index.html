                <h3 style="text-align: center;color: gray;">Cookies</h3>
                <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.
                    Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short
                    while before falling back into the mixture.
                    Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix,
                    which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).
                    Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense
                    toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more
                    complex its flavor will be.
                    Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
                    Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least
                    4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so
                    that the cookies can spread evenly.
                    Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.
                    Cool completely before serving.
                    Enjoy!</p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;color: gray;">Thai Soup</h3>
                <p>Mix the chicken breast with ginger & garlic paste. Fry them in a pan with 1 tsp of vegetable oil for
                    5 mins. Then put them in a separate bowl.
                    Take one heavy saucepan and pour 5 cups of cold water. Mix the corn flour with water. Then pour all
                    the ingredients one by one. Once done with mixing put the pan on the cooker. Keep it on high flame
                    for 5 minutes and keep stir in.
                    When the soup will start boiling turn the flame on low. Once it thicken turn of the gas. Serve in a
                    soup bowl.
                    This soup can be served with baguette or normal bread.</p>

                <p>Mix 1 tablespoon butter with parsley, garlic and soy sauce.
                    Sprinkle steak with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat remaining butter over medium heat. Add
                    steak; cook until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a thermometer should read 135°;
                    medium, 140°; medium-well, 145°), 4-7 minutes per side. Serve with garlic butter.</p>
